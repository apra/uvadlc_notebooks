    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the content are borrowed from the awesome post [Real Python-Three Ways of Storing and Accessing Lots of Images in Python](https://realpython.com/storing-images-in-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you want to know more about different ways of storing and accessing images in Python? If you’re segmenting a handful of images by color or detecting faces one by one using OpenCV, then you don’t need to worry about it. Even if you’re using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to draw on a few hundred photos, you still don’t need to. Storing images on disk, as .png or .jpg files, is both suitable and appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasingly, however, the number of images required for a given task is getting larger and larger. Algorithms like convolutional neural networks, also known as convnets or CNNs, can handle enormous datasets of images and even learn from them. If you’re interested, you can read more about how convnets can be used for ranking selfies or for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ImageNet](https://image-net.org/) is a well-known public image database put together for training models on tasks like object classification, detection, and segmentation, and it consists of over 14 million images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how long it would take to load all of them into memory for training, in batches, perhaps hundreds or thousands of times. Keep reading, and you’ll be convinced that it would take quite awhile—at least long enough to leave your computer and do many other things while you wish you worked at Google or NVIDIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be playing with image reading/writing in three different ways:\n",
    "* Disk\n",
    "* LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database)\n",
    "* HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we will see how these methods perform over various amount of data.\n",

    "##### Getting Started With LMDB\n",
    "LMDB, sometimes referred to as the “Lightning Database,” stands for Lightning Memory-Mapped Database because it’s fast and uses memory-mapped files. It’s a key-value store, not a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of implementation, LMDB is a B+ tree, which basically means that it is a tree-like graph structure stored in memory where each key-value element is a node, and nodes can have many children. Nodes on the same level are linked to one another for fast traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, key components of the B+ tree are set to correspond to the page size of the host operating system, maximizing efficiency when accessing any key-value pair in the database. Since LMDB high-performance heavily relies on this particular point, LMDB efficiency has been shown to be dependent on the underlying file system and its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key reason for the efficiency of LMDB is that it is memory-mapped. This means that it returns direct pointers to the memory addresses of both keys and values, without needing to copy anything in memory as most other databases do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the Python binding for the LMDB C library, which can be installed via pip:"

    "HDF5 stands for Hierarchical Data Format, a file format referred to as HDF4 or HDF5. We don’t need to worry about HDF4, as HDF5 is the current maintained version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, HDF has its origins in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, as a portable, compact scientific data format. If you’re wondering if it’s widely used, check out [NASA’s blurb on HDF5](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis/esco/standards-and-references/hdf-eos5) from their Earth Data project. HDF files consist of two types of objects (1)Datasets (2)Groups. Datasets are multidimensional arrays, and groups consist of datasets or other groups. Multidimensional arrays of any size and type can be stored as a dataset, but the dimensions and type have to be uniform within a dataset. Each dataset must contain a homogeneous N-dimensional array. That said, because groups and datasets may be nested, you can still get the heterogeneity you may need:"
